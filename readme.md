## Game Concept

The Memory Card Game is a top-notch tool designed to enhance memory retention. It's a recommended tool for both children and adults, especially those recovering from cognitive impairments such as post-stroke conditions. We realized the gap in the market for a simple, free application of this nature, which inspired us to create this game for the Telegram contest.

**Key Features:**

1. **Daily Trainer:** Designed to be a daily cognitive exercise, the game gradually increases in complexity to challenge and improve your memory.
2. **Progressive Levels:** Start at a beginner's level with 6 cards, and watch the number of cards increase as you advance through the game.
3. **Performance Tracking:** Our game keeps track of your performance statistics, allowing users to monitor and witness their improvement over time.

## Feedback on Developing Telegram's WebApp

### What We Appreciated

- Telegram's client uses modern webViews, which lets developers use the newest JS features without worries about compatibility.
- The "@twa-dev/types" package is very useful. It gives types for WebApp features and acts like a guide or reference.
- The WebApp API is easy to understand and use.
- The Telegram beta version has dev tools, making it easier to find and fix problems.
- Working with the WebApp was free of big problems. It felt like building a regular web site.

### Challenges Encountered

- We had some issues with cloud storage speed in the Telegram beta for macOS.
- Changing the style of the main and back buttons mainly uses JS, so we couldn't fully use CSS variables for theming
- The main button doesn't know HEX8 colors. We had to think of other ways to choose colors.
- To make sure everything works, we checked our designs in Safari. Looks like the macOS Telegram client uses Safari's engine.
- From tests with friends, we found that the Haptic Feedback doesn't always work. Some said they didn't feel any vibration.
